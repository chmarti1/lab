This file should contain three numbers separated by a newline.  There should be 
no spaces and no other characters before the second number.  These indicate the 
water flow rate in US gallons per hour, the air pressure in psig, and the 
standoff in inches.

4.0     <--- Water flow rate (GPH)
80      <--- Air pressure (psig)
.25     <--- Standoff (inches)

Air flow rate is calculated from the pressure assuming the area of an orifice
installed in the manifold where the two fluids are mixed.  The orifice is a 1/32
drilled hole (.4948mm^2 area).  The flow is assumed to be choked (sonic).
