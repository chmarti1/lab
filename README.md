## <a name="about"></a> About
In the summer of 2016, I realized I needed to be able to adjust my data 
acquisition parameters day-by-day as I was tweaking and optimizing an 
experiment.  I love my LabJack, and the folks at LabJack do a great job of documenting their intuitive interface.  HOWEVER, most of us don't memorize dozens of modbus registers, and weeks after an experiment it's often difficult to remember which data file was taken with which DAQ parameters.

This little **L**aboratory **CONFIG**uration system reads and writes configuration and data files, connects to and configures the T7, and automates the jobs I've done most.  As of version 2.02, that includes analog input streaming and analog output simulating a function generator.

## <a name="start"></a> Getting started
To get the repository,

```
    $ git clone http://github.com/chmarti1/lab
    $ cd lab
    $ make drun
    $ make dburst
    $ ./drun -h   # prints help
    $ ./dburst -h # prints help
```
`drun` and `dburst` are probably the best places to get started.  They load a configuration file, open the appropriate device connections, initiate the data transfer, and write data files automatically.

For writing your own executables, a quick tutorial on programming with the LCONFIG system is laid out in LCONFIG_README with the gritty details in this README.  The absolute authoritative documentation for LCONFIG is the comments in the prototype section of the header itself.  It is always updated with each version change.

Once you produce your data, there's a good chance that you'll want to analyze it.  If you're a Python user, the lconfig.py module will get you up and running quickly.  Its documentation is inline.

## <a name="config"></a> Anatomy of an LCONFIG configuration file
A configuration file has MANY optional contents, but all configuration files will have a few things in common.  ALL configuration directives have the same format; a parameter followed by a value separated by whitespace.
```
# Configuration files can contain comments
# The first directive always has to be a conneciton type. The connection
# directive tells LCONFIG what interface to use to reach the T7.  It 
# also tells LCONFIG to start configuring a new device.  This allows a
# single configuration file to specify connections to multiple devices.
connection eth

# If the connection is over tcp/ip, then the IP address is used to 
# specify which device is being configured.  If the connection is over
# USB, then the ip address is treated like any other parameter, and will
# be written to the device.  
ip 192.168.10.10

# We can also set some global acquisition options
samplehz 100
nsample 32
settleus 100

# Just like the connection parameter indicates that we've started new
# device connection, aichannel indicates that we're talking about a new
# analog input channel.  This indicates the physical port from which
# analog data should be collected.  MUX80 channel numbers are not 
# supported in version 2.02.
aichannel 0

# To put the channel in differential mode, the negative can be specified
# to the neighboring odd channel number.
ainegative 1

# Now that we specify aichannel 2, all following analog input directives
# will be applied to this analog input and not the last one. Oh, by the 
# way, LCONFIG is case insensitive.
AIchAnnEl 2
ainegative 3
AIRANGE 0.1

##
Configuration files end when the file ends or when the load_config() 
function encounters ##.  This text isn't commented because
it will never be read by load_config()
```

## <a name="data"></a> Anatomy of a data file
Data files are written with the device configuration that was used to collect the data embedded in the file's header.  Because ## ends the configuration section, `load_config()` can open a data file just as easily as it can a configuration file.  That means an experiment can be run to repeat prior data simply by specifying the prior data file as the configuration file.

Below are the first 26 lines of a data file.  The configuration section is terminated by the ## flag, and the date and time at which the measurement was started is recorded behind a #: prefix. 

From there, each line represents a scan of all the configured channels.  Data are separated by whitespace.  Time values are not listed since they can be reconstructed from the SAMPLEHZ parameter.

## <a name="params"></a> Table of Parameters
These are the parameters recognized by LCONFIG.  The valid values list the values or classes of values that each parameter can legally be assigned.  The scope indicates where those values are applied.  Global scope parameters are always overwritten if they are repeated, but AI and AO parameters are written to which ever channel is active, and there may be many.

| Parameter   | Valid Values                            | Scope        | Description
|:------------|:---------------------------------------:|:------------:|:--|
| connection  | eth,usb,any                             | Global       | Starts configuration of a new device and specifies over what interface that device should be reached.
| serial      | integer                                 | Global       | Specifies a device by its serial number (ignored over eth when ip is also specified)
| ip          | XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX                         | Global       | Over an ETH connection, specifies the devices to configure, but over a USB connection, IP is used to set the devices IP address.
| gateway     | XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX                         | Global       | Used to set the T7's default TCP/IP gateway
| subnet      | XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX                         | Global       | Used to set the T7's TCP/IP subnet mask
| samplehz    | floating point                          | Global       | The sample rate per channel in Hz
| settleus    | floating point                          | Global       | The settling time per sample in microseconds. If less than 5, the T7 will choose automatically.
| nsample     | integer                                 | Global       | How many samples per channel should be included in each stream packet?
| aichannel   | integer [0-13]                          | Analog Input | The physical analog input channel number
| ainegative  | [0-13], 199, ground, differential       | Analog Input | The physical channel to use as the negative side of the measurement.  199 and ground both indicate a single-ended measurement.  The T7 requires that negative channels be the odd channel one greater than the even positive counterpart (e.g. 0+ 1- or 8+ 9-).  Specify differential to make that selection automatic.
| airange     | float [.01, .1, 1., 10.]                | Analog Input  | The bipolar (+/-) voltage range for the measurement.  The T7 can accept four values.
| airesolution| integer 
| aochannel   | integer [0,1]                           | Analog Output | The physical analog output (DAC) channel to use for pseudo function generator output.
| aosignal    | constant, sine, square, triangle, noise | Analog Output | The type of cyclic signal to generate
| aoamplitude | floating point                          | Analog Output | Voltage amplitude of the AC component of the signal (ignored for constant signal).
| aooffset    | floating point                          | Analog Output | Offset (DC) voltage to add to the oscillating (AC) signal.
| aoduty      | floating point [0-1]                    | Analog Output | The duty cycle of triangle and square waves. This skews the signal to spend more time on one part of the wave than the other.
| aofrequency | floating point                          | Analog Output | Specifies the rate the wave will repeat in Hz.
| meta        | flt/float, int/integer, str/string, stop/end/none | Meta | Starts a meta parameter stanza.  Any unrecognized parameter name after this directive will be treated as a new meta parameter of the specified type.  If stop, end, or none is specified, the meta stanza is ended, and unrecognized parameters will cause errors again.
| flt:param   | floating point                          | Meta | Specifies a single floating point meta parameter.
| int:param   | integer                                 | Meta | Specifies a single integer parameter
| str:param   | string                                  | Meta | Specifies a single string parameter

### Interacting with Configuration Files

```C
int load_config(          DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devmax, 
                       const char* filename)
```
`load_config` loads a configuration file into an array of DEVCONF structures.  Each instance of the `connection` parameter signals the configuration a new device.  `dconf` is an array of DEVCONF structs with `devmax` elements that will contain the configuration parameters found in the data file, `filename`.  The function returns either `LCONF_ERROR` or `LCONF_NOERR` depending on whether an error was raised during execution.

```C
void write_config(        DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum, 
                             FILE* ff)
```
`write_config` writes a configuration stanza to an open file, `ff`, for the parameters of device number `devnum` in the array, `dconf`.  A DEVCONF structure written by `write_config` should result in an identical structure after being read by `load_config`.

Rather than accept file names, `write_config` accepts an open file pointer so it is convenient for creating headers for data files (which don't need to be closed after the configuration is written).  It also means that the write operation doesn't need to return an error status.

<a name='fun:dev'></a>
### Device Interaction
```C
int open_config(          DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum)
```
`open_config` opens a connection to the device described in the `devnum` element of the `dconf` array.  The function returns either `LCONF_ERROR` or `LCONF_NOERR` depending on whether an error was raised during execution.

```C
int close_config(         DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum)
```
`close_config` closes a connection to the device described in the `devnum` element of the `dconf` array.  The function returns either `LCONF_ERROR` or `LCONF_NOERR` depending on whether an error was raised during execution.

```C
int upload_config(        DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum)
```
`upload_config` writes to the relevant modbus registers to assert the parameters in the `devnum` element of the `dconf` array.  The function returns either `LCONF_ERROR` or `LCONF_NOERR` depending on whether an error was raised during execution.

```C
int download_config(      DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum, 
                          DEVCONF* out)
```
`download_config` pulls values from the modbus registers of the open device connection in the `devnum` element of the `dconf` array to populate the parameters of the `out` DEVCONF struct.  This is a way to verify that the device parameters were successfully written or to see what operation was performed last.

It is important to note that some of the DEVCONF members configure parameters that are not used until a data operation is executed (like `nsample` or `samplehz`).  These parameters can never be downloaded because they do not reside persistently on the T7.

<a name='fun:diag'></a>
### Configuration Diagnostics
```C
int ndev_config(          DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devmax)
                
int nistream_config(      DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum)
                
int nostream_config(      DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum)
```
The `ndev_config` returns the number of devices configured in the `dconf` array, returning a number no greater than `devmax`.  `nistream_config` and `nostream_config` return the number of input and ouptut stream channels configured.

```C
void show_config(         DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum)
```
The `show_config` function calls `download_config` and prints a detailed color-coded comparison of live parameters against the configuration parameters in the `devnum` element of the `dconf` array.  Parameters that do not match are printed in red while parameters that agree with the configuration parameters are printed in green.

<a name='fun:data'></a>
### Data Collection
```C
int start_data_stream(    DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum,
                               int samples_per_read)

int read_data_stream(     DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum, 
                            double *data)

int stop_data_stream(     DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum)
```
There are three steps to the data acquisition process; start, read, and stop.  `start_data_stream` starts the data collection process on the device `devnum` in the `dconf` array.  The device will be configured to transfer packets with `samples_per_read` samples per channel.  If `samples_per_read` is negative, then the `nsample` configuration parameter will be used instead.

The `read_data_stream` function waits until a packet is available from the device and writes it to the `data` array.  Each call to `read_data_stream` will write `samples_per_read * nistream_config()` samples to the `data` array. This function must be called repeatedly and often enough to prevent a backlog of data.  If an excessive backlog builds higher than LCONF_BACKLOG_THRESHOLD samples, an error will be raised.

The process is halted by the `stop_data_stream` function.

```C
int start_file_stream(    DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum,
                               int samples_per_read, 
                        const char *filename)
                        
int read_file_stream(     DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum)
                
int stop_file_stream(     DEVCONF* dconf, 
                const unsigned int devnum)
```
Similar to the data stream functions, these file stream functions write samples directly to a formatted text file, and do not require a data buffer.

<a name='fun:meta'></a>
### Meta Configuration
```C
int get_meta_int(          DEVCONF* dconf, 
                 const unsigned int devnum,
                        const char* param, 
                               int* value)
                               
int get_meta_flt(          DEVCONF* dconf, 
                 const unsigned int devnum,
                        const char* param, 
                            double* value)

int get_meta_str(          DEVCONF* dconf, 
                 const unsigned int devnum,
                        const char* param, 
                              char* value)
```
The `get_meta_XXX` functions retrieve meta parameters from the `devnum` element of the `dconf` array by their name, `param`.  If the parameter does not exist or if it is of the incorrect type, 
The values are written to target of the `value` pointer, and the function returns the `LCONF_ERROR` or `LCONF_NOERR` error status based on whether the parameter was found.

```C
int put_meta_int(          DEVCONF* dconf, 
                 const unsigned int devnum, 
                        const char* param, 
                                int value)
                                
int put_meta_flt(          DEVCONF* dconf, 
                 const unsigned int devnum, 
                        const char* param, 
                             double value)

int put_meta_str(          DEVCONF* dconf, 
                 const unsigned int devnum, 
                        const char* param, 
                              char* value)
```
The `put_meta_XXX` functions retrieve meta parameters from the `devnum` element of the `dconf` array by their name, `param`.  The values are written to target of the `value` pointer, and the function returns the `LCONF_ERROR` or `LCONF_NOERR` error status based on whether the parameter was found.
