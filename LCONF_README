LCONFIG.H
README

The LCONFIG or Laboratory CONFiguration header is a tool for automating 
experiments and data collection with the LabJack T7 in the C language.  The 
philosophy is that researchers will construct their own executables that read in
configuration files with instructions on how to configure the DAQ for the test.
The most common things researchers need to specify should all be exposed through
the configuration file (e.g. PGA gain, differential/single-ended measurements,
sample rate, analog output functionality, etc...).

This document provides a quick introduction to using the header; assuming basic
familiarity with the C language.  Detailed documentation is provided in the 
header itself.  The function prototypes are written with comments describing 
their behavior and use.


***************
** Basic Use **
***************
Be sure to start your code by including the header:
"""
#include "lconfig.h"
"""

The workhorse datatype of the LCONFIG functions is the DEVCONF struct.  Short 
for DEVice CONFiguration, it contains data taken from a configuration file for 
one device.  Your code should include something like this:
"""
DEVCONF dconf[8];
"""
This creates an array of 8 possible configured devices.  Naturally, they don't
all need to be configured, but that will be up to the author of the 
configuration file.

Loading a configuration file is straightforward.  The dconf array will 
automatically be configured based on the parameter-value pairs found in the 
file.  If the maximum number allowed in the current application is exceeded by
the file, an error is generated.  All LCONFIG functions generate error messages
on their own, but the application can check the returned integer for an error;
0 implies success, and 1 implies an error was encountered.
"""
int err;
err = load_config(dconf, 8, "configuration_file_name");
"""

Running an experiment can be simple. This example loads a single device from a
configuration file and writes 128 samples to a tab-delimited data file.
"""
load_config(dconf,1,"myconfig.conf");
start_file_stream(dconf, 0, 128, "output_file_name");
read_file_stream(dconf, 0);
stop_file_stream(dconf, 0);
"""
The data file will include a header that is also readable by load_config(). 
Using an output file as a config file will cause LCONFIG to repeat the 
experiment that lead to the data (to the extent that it controls the 
experiment).


**********************************
** Writing a Configuration File **
**********************************
Configuration files are written in parameter-value pairs separated by 
whitespace.  For example,
"""
connection usb
"""
specifies the value "usb" for the parameter "connection".

Configuration files are completely case insensitive.  All A-Z values are 
replaced with their lower-case equivalents in load_config(), so feel free to use
any capitalization scheme that is pleasing to you.  The strings are interpreted
into floats or integers as needed based on the individual parameter.

When a '#' is encountered at the beginning of a word, the remainder of the line
is ignored as a comment.  When a '#' character appears in the middle of a word,
it is interpreted like any other character.

load_config() will stop processing the file either when the file ends or when it
encounters a double-# ("##") at the beginning of a word, signaling the end of 
the configuration section.  This is useful because it allows load_config() to 
parse configuration directives at the head of a data file.

The device is identified either by its IP address or its serial number.  If the
connection is over USB, the IP address is interpreted as a directive to be 
written to the T7.  If the connection is over ethernet, then the IP address is
the preferred way to identify the device.  A serial number can be used in either
case, but it is extremely inefficient over ethernet.

Version 1.1 of LCONF accepts the following parameters that configure the device:
conneciton  [eth|usb|any]   How to connect to the T7?
serial      The device serial number
IP          The device's IP address
gateway     IP address of the subnet's gateway (only used in USB)
subnet      The subnet mask of the subnet (only used in USB)
samplehz    The stream sample rate in Hz

Analog inputs are configured individually.  Each of the global parameters above 
only appear once in a configuration file, but these can appear multiple times.
A new analog input stream is created by the AICHANNEL parameter.  All following
analog input parameters will be applied to that stream, so AICHANNEL always
appears first.

aichannel   [0-13]  Channel number of the analog measurement.
airange     [0.01 | 0.1 | 1. | 10.]   Bipolar voltage input range.
ainegative  [aichannel+1 | 199 | ground]  Negative voltage source (199=GND)
airesolution    The resolution index used by the T7

The output stream works in the same way as the input streams.  The AOCHANNEL 
parameter indicates the creation of a new stream, and all output parameters
after apply to that stream.  Outputs mimic a function generator; repeating in a
loop.  Therefore, the output parameters are quite different.

aochannel   [0 | 1] Channel number of the analog output
aosignal    [constant | sine | square | triangle | noise]
aofrequency     The signal repetition frequency in Hz
aoamplitude     The signal amplitude (1/2 pk-pk)
aooffset        The signal offset
aoduty          Duty cycle for square and triangle

The last class of parameters recognized by version 1.1 is meta.  Meta parameters
are not inherently recognized by LCONF, but might be used by the host 
application.  As a result, the configuration file needs to specify what kind of
data the parameter uses.

int:param
flt:param
str:param


**************************
** High Speed Streaming **
**************************
Streaming to files limits speed quite severely.  Requesting higher data 
acquisition rates with the example above can cause buffer warnings.  In these
applications, it is important to stream to memory instead.
"""
double data[512];
start_data_stream(dconf, 0, 128);
read_data_stream(dconf, 0, data);
stop_data_stream(dconf, 0);
"""
This approach solves the problem, but can get memory-intensive for long runs.


***********************
** Signal Generation **
***********************
The application software need do nothing to configure analog outputs.  They 
start when the stream starts.  However, when driving a system with an output, it
is often important to let the system stabilize to a quasi-steady-state system 
before conducting a measurement.  That could be included as a meta-parameter,
but it is not currently offered as a formal parameter.  Instead, here is a 
convenient way to go about the process.
"""
double data[512];
start_file_stream(dconf,0,128);
read_data_stream(dconf,0,data);
read_file_stream(dconf,0);
stop_file_stream(dconf,0);
"""
The 128 samples read by read_data_stream would bypass the file.
